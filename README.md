# Node.js Project with Prisma ORM for Product Management API

## Description

This Node.js project utilizes Prisma as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool to create a basic product management system API. This README file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to set it up and get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- npm: npm is included with Node.js, so no additional installation is required.
- PostgreSQL: This project uses PostgreSQL as the database. Make sure you have a PostgreSQL server running and accessible.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Change into the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Install project dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up your environment variables**:

   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.

   - Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:

     ```plaintext
     DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/your-database"
     ```

     Replace `username`, `password`, and `your-database` with your PostgreSQL credentials and database name.

5. **Apply database migrations** to create the database schema:

   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```

6. **Seed the database with initial data** (optional):

   ```bash
   npx prisma db seed --preview-feature
   ```

7. **Start the server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Your Node.js application is now up and running.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```plaintext
project-root
├── src/
│   ├── db/
│   │   ├── schema.prisma     # Prisma schema file
│   ├── controllers/           # API route controllers
│   ├── routes/                # Express routes
│   ├── app.js                # Express application setup
├── .env                      # Environment variables
├── package.json              # Project dependencies and scripts
└── README.md                 # Project documentation (this file)
```

## Usage

To access the API and interact with the product management system, you can use tools like `curl`, `Postman`, or any other API client.

- **API base URL:** `http://localhost:3000`

The available API endpoints include:

- **GET /products**: Retrieve a list of all products.
- **GET /products/:id**: Retrieve a specific product by ID.
- **POST /products**: Create a new product.
- **PUT /products/:id**: Update a product by ID.
- **DELETE /products/:id**: Delete a product by ID.

Make sure to check the route files in the `src/routes` directory for detailed API routes and request/response examples.
```

Save this content in a file named `README.md` in your project's root directory.
